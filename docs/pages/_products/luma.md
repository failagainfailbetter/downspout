## Functionality

Luma turns an 8x8 Launchpad-style grid into a set of lightweight musical
agents. Lower rows create stable bass and chord movement, upper rows add melody
fragments and drum sparks, and the plugin sends LED feedback back to the
controller when the host routes its MIDI output to the Launchpad. Unhandled
input MIDI is blocked by default, with a `Pass` switch for deliberate forwarding.
