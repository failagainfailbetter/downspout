# bassgen port

This directory holds the `downspout` port of `~/github/flues/lv2/bassgen`.

`bassgen` is a transport-aware MIDI bass generator with persistent pattern
state, loop-boundary variation, and a custom DPF UI. In `downspout`, the core
now stores normalized meter data and shapes rhythm around pulse starts,
pickups, and longer pulse-spanning notes rather than assuming every bar is
effectively `4/4`. It also now exposes explicit style modes:
`Auto`, `Straight`, `Reel`, `Waltz`, `Jig`, and `Slip Jig`.

The DPF wrapper accepts incoming MIDI as context. The `Follow/Dodge` control
can make bass notes more likely on incoming drum/bass hits or suppress bass
notes on those beats. `Input Match` chooses whether input must match one exact
note, any note on the listen channel, or any note at all. `Input Sensitivity`
scales how strongly that input affects follow/dodge probability and, in channel
or any-note matching, how far injected follow notes are pulled toward a
companion interval above the incoming guide pitch.
The `Color` control adjusts harmonic tension: for Jazz it moves dominant bars
from inside/bebop material toward altered, diminished, and whole-tone colors,
for Fugue it adds leading-tone pickup behavior, while other genres use it for
more blues, tritone, modal, or passing-note movement without changing the
selected scale.

Implementation status:

- portable core library exists and builds;
- deterministic tests exist and pass;
- host-neutral block engine exists for MIDI scheduling;
- text state serialization exists for controls, pattern, and variation;
- the DPF wrapper and custom UI build as `bassgen.vst3`;
- the core now handles shared-meter transport input and regenerates on meter
  changes;
- the core now has explicit style controls for simple, reel, waltz, jig, and
  slip-jig phrasing on top of the shared meter model;
- scale choices now include Lydian, Melodic Minor, Whole Tone, Altered,
  Half-Whole Diminished, Whole-Half Diminished, Bebop Dominant, Bebop Major,
  and Bebop Minor in addition to the original minor/major/modal/pentatonic/
  blues options. These were appended to the scale enum to preserve existing
  saved-state values;
- the appended Jazz genre biases rhythm toward walking beat anchors and maps
  four-bar phrases across ii-V-I-turnaround roots, with role-specific Dorian,
  Mixolydian/altered, and Major/Lydian color for ordinary scales. Dominant
  bars choose from Mixolydian, altered, half-whole diminished, whole-tone, and
  bebop dominant material, and beat-start notes target roots, thirds, fifths,
  and sevenths. One- and two-subdivision pickups add chromatic approaches and
  simple enclosures around the next chord-tone target while explicitly selected
  Jazz color scales remain constrained to their chosen vocabulary;
- the appended Fugue genre biases rhythm toward flowing subject steps and maps
  four-bar phrases across tonic subject, dominant answer, short episode, and
  tonic pedal/cadence behavior;
- the general `Color` control is serialized and exposed in the UI, and affects
  Jazz dominant color, Fugue leading tones, and genre-specific tension choices
  for Funk, Acid, Dub, Ambient, Sabbath, and the electronic styles;
- incoming MIDI follow/dodge controls are wired through the wrapper, core, and
  UI, including channel/any-note input matching and input sensitivity for
  Ground-guided companion lines.
